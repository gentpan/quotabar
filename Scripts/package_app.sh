# Builds QuotaBar.app in place.

# Signing tiers, picked automatically:
#   1. Developer ID Application certificate present -> hardened-runtime signature
#      that Gatekeeper accepts once the app is also notarized.
#   2. Nothing present -> ad-hoc signature. Runs on this Mac only; anyone else
#      who downloads it gets "QuotaBar is damaged and can't be opened", which is
#      Gatekeeper's (badly worded) way of saying "unsigned".
#
# Notarizing additionally requires a stored notarytool credential:
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials QuotaBar \
#     --apple-id you@example.com --team-id <YOUR_TEAM_ID>
#   NOTARIZE=1 ./Scripts/package_app.sh
