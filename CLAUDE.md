# QuotaBar

macOS 14+ menu-bar app that shows how much of each AI coding provider's quota is
used and when each window resets. Swift 6 toolchain, SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra`, no
third-party dependencies.

- `Sources/QuotaCore` — provider protocol, HTTP/date helpers, config + keychain,
  credential readers, cost estimator, one file per provider group.
- `Sources/QuotaBar` — the SwiftUI app: usage store, menu-bar icon, panel,
  settings, notch island.
- `Tests/QuotaCoreTests` — everything testable lives in QuotaCore.

## Build

**A full Xcode toolchain is required.** CommandLineTools does not ship the
`SwiftUIMacros` plugin, so `@State` fails to expand and the build dies with
`external macro implementation type ... could not be found`.

```bash
export DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer
swift build && swift test
./Scripts/package_app.sh   # builds QuotaBar.app in place, ad-hoc signed
```

`package_app.sh` signs with a Developer ID certificate when one is present
(hardened runtime + secure timestamp, which is what notarization requires) and
falls back to ad-hoc otherwise. `NOTARIZE=1` additionally submits to Apple and
staples the ticket; it needs a `notarytool` keychain profile. The script prints
the Gatekeeper verdict at the end — do not assume a build is distributable
because it compiled.

`Scripts/release.sh` wraps that into a full release (zip + SHA-256 + Homebrew
cask) and hard-fails if `spctl` still rejects the bundle — a build that only
works on the developer's own Mac must never ship.

Distribution is Developer ID only. The App Store sandbox forbids reading
`~/.codex` / `~/.claude` and other apps' keychain items, which is the entire
feature set, so `Resources/QuotaBar.entitlements` is deliberately empty and the
app runs unsandboxed.

`Scripts/dev.sh` runs the bare debug binary — fast, but there is no bundle, so
`Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier` is nil. Anything gated on a bundle (notifications,
`SMAppService`, `AppIcon.icns`) must degrade instead of trapping.

## Looking at the UI

```bash
.build/debug/QuotaBar --snapshot ./snapshots
```

Renders the panel off-screen to PNGs (both languages, four states) — the app is
a menu-bar agent, so there is no window to screenshot. CI runs this as a smoke
test. Two `ImageRenderer` limitations to read past; neither reflects the
running app:

- `ScrollView` contents are not laid out — panels render with `scrollable: false`.
- AppKit-backed controls (`.borderless` buttons, `ProgressView`, `Toggle`,
  `SecureField`) come out as yellow placeholder glyphs.

The settings window renders separately:

```bash
.build/debug/QuotaBar --settings-preview ./settings
```

One PNG per section, both languages, both appearances, plus one with a provider
expanded. Every `@State` in `SettingsView` is seeded from `init` rather than
`onAppear` precisely so this works — `ImageRenderer` runs outside a SwiftUI
update transaction and traps on a change queued from `onAppear`. Glass and
vibrancy are composited by AppKit and do not survive the renderer, so the
preview substitutes flat fills of the same metrics: read it for spacing,
alignment and truncation, and judge the material on screen.

## Rules

### Bilingual UI

Every user-visible string goes through `L10n.t("English", "中文")`. There is no
`.strings` bundle on purpose: `package_app.sh` assembles the app by hand and the
dev loop runs the bare binary, so a `Bundle.module` lookup would behave
differently between the two. Brand names (`ProviderID.displayName`) stay
untranslated.

### Credentials

Manually entered tokens/cookies/API keys go to the **login keychain only**, via
`ConfigStore.setCredential`. Never write a secret to `config.json`; `QuotaConfig`
decodes a legacy `credentials` key purely to drain it into the keychain and
never encodes it back. Automatic providers (Codex, Claude, Gemini) read the
session the user's CLI already created — never prompt for a password.

### Config decoding is per-field lenient

`decodeIfPresent` tolerates a *missing* key but throws on an unrecognised
value, which fails the whole file and silently resets every other preference.
Enum fields therefore go through `decodeEnum`, and `enabled` through
`decodeProviders`, which drops ids this build does not know rather than
discarding the list. This matters on downgrade: a newer build writes a style
or a provider an older one cannot parse. Covered by `ConfigResilienceTests`.

### Dictionaries keyed by an enum do not encode as objects

`Codable` flattens `[ProviderID: T]` into an array (`["codex", value, ...]`),
not an object. This already bit `config.json` and `history.json`. Key persisted
dictionaries by `String` and, if the file shipped before, keep a reader for the
old flat-array form.

### Window rows carry structure, not a sentence

A `UsageWindow` reports `windowSeconds` and `scope` separately from its
`title`. The UI renders the length as a badge ("5h", "7d") and the scope as the
only caption, so an account-wide window gets no caption at all — repeating
"whole account" on every row is filler. Providers that know the length must set
`windowSeconds`; `title` stays as the full label for accessibility and for rows
with no fixed length (balances, billing cycles).

### Provider parsing

Split every provider into a networking `fetch` and a pure `static parse(_ data:)`,
then pin the parser with a recorded response in `ProviderParsingTests`. Derive
window labels from what the API reports (`WindowTitle.forSeconds`) — never
hardcode "5-hour window"; the same field is a weekly window on other plans.
Scrub account identifiers out of recorded fixtures.

### Cost estimation

`CostEstimator` reads the CLIs' own session logs. Two things are easy to get
wrong and are covered by tests:

- **Deduplicate.** Claude Code writes the same assistant turn into every session
  file that replays it; over half the rows in a real tree are duplicates. Key on
  `(message.id, requestId)`.
- **Do not double-charge cached input.** Codex reports `input_tokens` inclusive
  of `cached_input_tokens`.

**Prices come from `PricingCatalog`, not the table in `Cost.swift`.** That
table is the offline fallback only. It prefix-matches, which is actively wrong
for models it has never seen: this developer's Codex usage is `gpt-5.6-sol`,
which matched `gpt-5` at $1.25/$10 against a real $4/$20 and understated that
provider threefold. The catalog matches exact ids (plus a date-stamp strip) and
never prefix-matches. Tests that pin the fallback must inject an empty catalog,
or they assert against whatever prices this machine happens to have fetched.

Anthropic charges 1.25x input for a 5-minute cache write and 2x for a 1-hour
one; the catalog publishes only the 5-minute figure, so the long one is derived.
When touching the fallback table, re-check numbers against the `claude-api`
skill rather than memory, and keep the most specific marker first (`sonnet-5`
before `sonnet`).

### Pace

`UsageWindow.pace()` needs no history: window length, reset time and the current
figure are enough. Note that "will exhaust before reset" and "is ahead of pace"
are the *same predicate* under linear extrapolation — the algebra reduces to
`used > 100 * elapsed / length`. Both names are kept because one reads better,
not because one is stricter; `WindowPaceTests` pins the equivalence so nobody
later treats them as different signals.

**The scan is over tens of gigabytes.** A real Codex tree measured 30GB across
112 files, next to 1GB of Claude logs — and the rows that matter are 0.2% of
those bytes. The hot path therefore never builds a `String` per line: it scans
raw bytes with `memchr`/`memmem` and only materialises `Data` for lines that
match. Codex records are matched on the first 8KB only (its `type` field sits
near the start); Claude's must be searched in full because `usage` comes after
the message content. Files are parsed in parallel, largest first. Together these
took a cold scan from 278s to 36s — do not undo them casually, and re-measure
with `QuotaBar --cost` if you touch the scanner.

`ChunkBoundaryTests` exists because every other fixture in the suite is a few
hundred bytes and never crosses a read block. Keep it.

Results are memoised in memory by (path, mtime, size), so steady-state refreshes
are free — but the cost is paid again on every launch. A persistent cache is the
remaining win if that matters.

### Staleness is never silent

A failed refresh keeps the previous numbers as `.stale(snapshot, error:)`, which
renders a banner. Do not collapse it back into `.loaded` — that is how a user
ends up trusting a figure from an expired session.

### Updating

`Updater` downloads a release, verifies it, and only then swaps the bundle.
**Verification is the point of the feature.** An updater that installs what it
downloaded is a remote-code-execution path, so a staged bundle is installed
only when `codesign` reports our own `TeamIdentifier` *and* `spctl` accepts it
(which covers notarization). This is stronger than a self-managed signing key —
an attacker would need the Developer ID certificate, not just the download URL.
`UpdateVerificationTests` builds a real unsigned bundle and asserts it is
refused; do not weaken that test into a stub.

Homebrew installs are detected via `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/quotabar` and are
never replaced in place — doing so desyncs brew's metadata and the next
`brew upgrade` fights it. Those users are pointed at `brew upgrade` instead.

The feed is configurable: `owner/repo` means GitHub's releases API, anything
with a scheme is a JSON endpoint returning `{"version", "url", "notes"}`. A
malformed stored value falls back to the default rather than silently becoming
a feed that never resolves.

### Alternate presentations

Three surfaces beyond the menu bar, in `IslandWindow`, `EdgeDock` and
`DesktopWidget`. `presentation` picks at most one of the notch island and the
edge dock; the desktop widget is an independent toggle, since it sits alongside
the menu bar rather than replacing it — hence `widgetRevision` as its own
change signal.

Never resize one of these panels with `setFrame(_:display:animate:)`. It steps
the resize on a **blocking** run-loop loop — measured at 341ms of stalled main
thread for the dock's reveal, against 0.6ms for `animator().setFrame` inside an
`NSAnimationContext` — and it relayouts the hosting view on every step, so the
SwiftUI content cannot animate at all while it runs. The panel frame and the
content it holds must also share one clock (`EdgeDockCoordinator.slide`), or
the content swaps instantly and the frame catches up afterwards.

Two sources drive the dock's frame: the hover transition, and a `GeometryReader`
reporting the strip's measured height. The second used to land an un-animated
`setFrame` one layout pass into the first, cutting the reveal off partway — the
animation still completed, so it looked fine in a log and stuttered on screen.
`DockSlide.decide` is the rule that fixed it and is pinned by `DockSlideTests`:
re-applying the frame already pending is a no-op, and a genuine content resize
arriving mid-slide joins the slide instead of snapping. Compare against the
*pending* frame, never `panel.frame` — mid-slide that reports an in-between
value and never compares equal.

Two more rules these share. Floating panels that show information beside
something else (the dock's hover callout) get their own panel with
`ignoresMouseEvents = true`: widening the host panel to contain them leaves a
transparent region that swallows clicks meant for the window underneath.
Positions are stored as fractions of `visibleFrame`, clamped on both read and
write, so a resolution change or a hand-edited config cannot park a panel
off-screen.

The desktop widget defaults to desktop level — above the icons, below every
window. Floating it over the user's work is a different and more intrusive
thing, so it is opt-in.

### Design tokens

Spacing, radii and surfaces come from `Design` in `DesignTokens.swift`. Radius
tiers are deliberate (tile / card / panel); do not flatten them. Cards use a
fill **or** a border, never both, and no gradients or glassmorphism.

The accent is a neutral graphite **and inverts between appearances**
(`QuotaTheme.accentHex` / `accentDarkHex`): a dark selection block sinks into a
dark window, so dark mode gets a light block with dark ink. It is neutral on
purpose — the panel already carries eleven provider brand colours and a twelfth
competing hue makes none of them legible. `QuotaBar --theme-preview <dir>`
renders the panel across candidate accents if it ever needs revisiting.

The glyph reports whichever provider the panel is focused on — `selected` in
the config, persisted, because it decides what the icon means and a choice that
reset on every launch would change that silently. An unknown or since-disabled
id falls back to the overview, which aggregates across everything enabled.

The glyph is driven by a `MeterReading`, not one number: quota windows split
into a **short** horizon (under a day — 5-hour, rolling) and a **long** one (a
day or more, plus billing cycles with no fixed length), each taking the highest
reading across enabled providers. `dual` draws them as two stacked rows and is
the default; every other style collapses them to `headline` (the higher of the
two). Collapsing hides which limit is actually near — a real account here reads
31% short against 100% long, and a single meter shows only the 100%.

A plan may report just one horizon (a Codex Pro account has no 5-hour window),
so `dual` falls back to a single centred row rather than drawing an empty one,
which would read as "nothing left".

Nine menu-bar glyphs live in `MenuBarIcon`. Four of them are *stepped*
(`dual` 5, `segments` 5, `grid` 9, `columns` 4) and declare it via
`MenuBarStyle.steps`: their gradations are countable, so the reading is exact
rather than estimated off a continuous fill.

Prefer linear gradations. A 3x3 `grid` is the most distinctive glyph but the
least readable: proportion along one axis is preattentive, while a grid has to
be counted in two dimensions. Ten segments were also tried and are worse than
five — at 22pt each cell falls to ~2pt and a filled cell stops being
distinguishable from an outlined one, so the finer gradations bought nothing. A stepped glyph
lights a cell only once its step is fully reached — except that any non-zero
value lights the first cell, or 1% and 0% look identical. **Unlit cells are
drawn as outlines, never as a faint fill**: alpha alone stops distinguishing
them once the glyph is tinted for an alert, and an exhausted quota then looks
identical to a full one. `QuotaBar
--icon-preview <dir>` renders every style across nine levels plus the Settings
picker, in both appearances.

Opening Settings takes two steps, not one: `openSettings()` followed by
`SettingsWindow.focus()`. The call alone does create the window, but an
accessory app is never activated as a side effect, so it is ordered in behind
whatever the user was looking at and the menu just closes with nothing visible.
Activating *before* the window exists does nothing — hence the runloop hop.
The legacy `showSettingsWindow:` selector does not work here at all; do not
reach for it.

The panel does not scroll. Only the notch island does, because it lives in a
fixed-size floating `NSPanel`; a clipped menu-bar panel hides the numbers the
app exists to show.

Collapsed, the island is a **notch strip** on a notched Mac: the figures sit in
the dead space either side of the notch rather than in a pill beside it. The two
sides are mirrored — figure on the outer edge, mark against the notch — so the
pair reads outward from the middle. Only two providers fit, which is the notch's
constraint and not a choice: the strip has to clear the app's own menus on one
side and the status items on the other, hence the 132pt `sideWidth`. On a screen
with no notch (`safeAreaInsets.top == 0`, most external displays) it falls back
to the old centred pill — a strip built around a zero-width notch is just a bar
sitting on top of the menu bar's own items.

The strip shows a reset countdown next to each figure, via `QuotaFormat.tick`
rather than `countdown`: the latter returns a localised phrase ("5 天 17 小时")
that does not fit in 60pt and truncates mid-number.

The figure takes the provider's own `accentHex`, and that colour is **not**
lifted for contrast at draw time. Every accent is instead required to clear
4.5:1 against black, asserted in `ProviderRegistryTests` — an accent that has to
be altered to be readable is the wrong accent, and mutating it at runtime would
ship a colour nobody chose. (The near-black *logos* are a different problem, and
the one `ProviderGlyph`'s `tint` solves.)

Snapshots render light **and** dark (`-dark` suffix). Dark mode needs
`NSAppearance.performAsCurrentDrawingAppearance` — adaptive colours resolve
against the drawing appearance, which `ImageRenderer` does not inherit from the
SwiftUI environment.

### The settings window

It is the one surface that opts into Liquid Glass, and the only place the
project's "a fill *or* a border, never both" rule is broken — a glass edge is
what separates a translucent card from the translucent thing behind it.

Scope is deliberate. The menu panel, the edge dock, the notch island and the
desktop widget stay on the flat `Design` surfaces: they sit over arbitrary
wallpaper and have to carry their own contrast, so glass there would put the
user's desktop behind the numbers the app exists to show. A settings window is
always in front of its own backdrop, so it can afford it.

`glassEffect` is macOS 26; the deployment target is macOS 14. Every call site
goes through `glassSurface` / `glassGroup` / `glassAction` in `GlassStyle.swift`
rather than scattering `if #available` through the layout — below 26 they fall
back to a frosted material with the same metrics, so nothing shifts.

Navigation is a sidebar, not a tab bar. Two tabs meant eleven preferences that
were not providers shared one scrolling `Form` in a 560pt window, and nothing
was findable.

The sidebar is an always-dark surface, so its colours are pinned rather than
adaptive — `Color.primary` and `Design.accent` resolve against the *system*
appearance and both go black-on-black in light mode, the same trap as the
provider logos.

Selection is `SidebarRail`, not a filled block: a hairline rail with a lit
segment that travels to the selected row. Three layers make it read as light
rather than as a painted tick — the rail and the segment both faded out at
their ends, a blurred bloom, and a horizontal bleed feathered on all four
sides. Drop any one and the effect collapses into a rectangle. The rail is
drawn once for the whole list and sits *behind* the rows so the bleed falls
under the label; it cannot belong to a row, since travelling between them is
its whole job. The travel is a spring with visible overshoot, because the
original is `cubic-bezier(0.37, 1.95, 0.66, 0.56)` and the 1.95 *is* the
overshoot — a timing curve would only approximate it.

Providers are an accordion, one open at a time. That is not only about the
length of the list: the expanded row is what constructs `CredentialEditor`, and
building it *is* the keychain read. Opening the window costs zero lookups
instead of eleven, and the read that does happen is the direct result of a
click. Do not hoist that read back up into the list.

Controls come from `SettingRow` (fixed `Design.labelColumn`), `SettingToggle`
(switch at the far right, as macOS does it) and `GlassSegmented`. The segmented
control is ours rather than `.pickerStyle(.segmented)` because AppKit paints its
selection in the *system* accent, which fights the eleven provider brand colours
the rest of the app is careful to stay out of the way of.

### Credential sources

Six ways a provider gets its credential, in order of preference:

1. **CLI login file** — Codex (`~/.codex/auth.json`), Gemini, Grok, OpenCode Go
   (`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`), read in the clear.
2. **Another app's keychain item** — Claude Code.
3. **Another app's local session store** — Cursor keeps its signed-in session
   in `state.vscdb`, a plain SQLite file (`SQLiteRead`). Not the cookie jar,
   which only holds the in-app browser's third-party cookies. The cookie
   cursor.com wants is `sub::JWT`, not the bare token — `sub` is a claim inside
   the JWT, and the composite is percent-encoded into the cookie.
4. **Manual paste** — the fallback for everything, stored in the keychain.

An automatic reader is always tried *after* a manually pasted credential, so a
user can override a stale local session. A provider that has both an automatic
reader and a manual fallback keeps its `credentialHint` non-nil.

There is no OAuth-in-app path: of the eleven providers only Google (Gemini)
permits third-party client registration, and it is already covered by the CLI
login file. Do not embed another CLI's `client_id`, and never a `client_secret`.

## Adding a provider

1. Implement `QuotaProvider` in `QuotaCore/Providers/`, with a pure `parse`.
2. Add the `ProviderID` case: display name, SF Symbol, accent hex, dashboard
   URL, `credentialHint` (nil for automatic providers), `setupHint`. The symbol
   is asserted to resolve *and* to be locale-stable: an invented name renders as
   nothing (`braces` shipped for OpenCode Go; it is `curlybraces`), and SF
   Symbols localises a few marks — `textformat` draws the word "格式" in
   Chinese, which shipped as Kimi's fallback.
3. Register it in `ProviderRegistry.make`.
4. Drop a logo PNG at `Sources/QuotaBar/Resources/logos/<rawValue>.png` and keep
   the SVG master in `Assets/`.
5. Add a fixture test.

`ProviderRegistryTests` asserts every case has complete metadata, so a missing
piece fails the suite rather than shipping a blank tile.
